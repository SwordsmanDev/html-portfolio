<h1>Arthur's Top 3 Movies</h1>
<h2>Here is a list of what I think are the the best movies of all time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Braveheart</h3>
<p>Drama, fighting, history - this movie got it all.</p>
<h3>Terminator 2</h3>
<p>
  An interesting take on the develepment of artificial intelligence in the
  future (which, at this point is already happening) <br />
  that becomes more and more relevant with years
</p>
<h3>The Gladiator</h3>
<p>Classic man's man movie, imo of course</p>
